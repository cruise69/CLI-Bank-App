it is a small project so, i don't think it needs any documentation whatsoever. a minute in and you will know how to use it, even tho it doesn't have a real world use.

you need a file named "Clients.txt" in the same folder as the compiled program for it to get the inputs.
its expression is like this: 
AccountNum\PIN\Name\Phone\Balance\

A554\2234\Isaac Bakor\325215335\925843\
A526\6575\Demetrius Demarcus Bartholomew The Third Jr\6660436824\4326445\
A569\2345\Abdo Salem\9984345452\4378256495\
A540\9643\Poor Louis\524364774\8043\

stack whoever you want. tho you can add, delete and edit clients and users through the program itself.
oh i almost forgot about the users.
**users** are people who are using the program like bank employees, they have permissions like -1 that have all permissions.
i dont really remember it so, you can check it out by going to the users permissions screen,
which will list all users along with their permissions.

users expression is something like:
UserName\Password\Permissions

admin\1234\-1\
user1\1111\60\
user2\4444\5\

and thats all you gotta need to start playing around with the thing.
Compile the cpp file and Play.
